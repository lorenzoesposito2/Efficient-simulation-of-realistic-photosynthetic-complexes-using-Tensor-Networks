## Efficient simulation of realistic photosynthetic complexes using Tensor Networks

This is the code used in my bachelor's degree thesis.

The main libraries used are:

- ITensor: https://itensor.org
- PseudomodesTTEDOPA made by my supervisor Dott. Davide Ferracin: https://github.com/phaerrax/PseudomodesTTEDOPA.jl

In the directory "Dimer" there is the code used for the simulation of the dimer with realistic environment
IN the directory "test" there is the code used for the simulation of the dimer with one oscillator environment
